# Advent of code 2024

My solutions to some [advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) problems.
This year the solutions are all written in [GO](https://go.dev/), a high level procedural programming language. 

My consistency and correctness has improved dramatically compared to my previous experience.
By christmas day 2024, I completed the following days. (`a` refers to part one, `b` refers to part 2)
- 1a
- 2a, 2b 
- 3a, 3b,
- 6a
- 7a, 7b
- 9a
- 11a
- 14a, 14b
- 15a 
- 17a 
- 18a
- 22a
- 24a
- 25a

### Boxing day boom
After the event ended, I returned to some projects to improve and experiment with my solutions.
- day_11
    - `day_11/main.go` completed a go implementation 
    - `day_11/day_11_c2` completed an array-backed dictionary implementation in C
    - `day_11/day_11_rust` rewrote solution in rust to compare performace to go and C
    - `day_11/day_11_custom_hash` implemented an experimental datastructure solution in C 
    - `day_11/day_11_cpp` ported C solution to C++ to use a professional hashmap implementation

### Try it out
Each day has its corresponding `day_` folder. Eg [day_1](day_1/). I do not condone cheating, **Do not use my code to solve the puzzles for you**. However, if you have completed your own solution and would like to compare approaches:
1. Open a terminal
2. Clone this repository
3. Install the go compiler
4. Open a `day_` folder such as `day_1`
5. Supply the puzzle input or example as `input.txt` inside the folder
6. Use `go run .` to compile run the `main.go` file
